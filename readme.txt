Quadruped robots equipped with manipulators require high-speed,
high-precision grasping and detection with low algorithmic complexity for supply transport, 
obstacle clearance, and rescue missions. 
To meet these requirements,
we developed a lightweight grasp detection convolutional neural network based on DenseBlock (DES-LGCNN).
The code is coming soon...
